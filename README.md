I Will Survive :
An interactive dashboard to explore cardiovascular risk factors in women

Overview
This project is the result of 9 weeks of intensive learning during the Le Wagon Data Analytics Bootcamp. Our team aimed to put data at the service of women’s health by creating an interactive dashboard that highlights key cardiovascular risk factors and offers insights to improve prevention strategies.

Why this project?
A striking paradox caught our attention: although men are more commonly affected by cardiovascular diseases, women in France have a 35% higher mortality rate from strokes each year. Understanding this statistical disparity became the central focus of our project.

Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights into cardiovascular risk factors specific to women using open datasets.
Correlation Matrix: Weighted analysis of existing risk factors to understand their combined impact.
Interactive Dashboard: A user-friendly interface for visualizing data trends and health recommendations.
Machine Learning: Risk modeling to identify and prioritize key areas for action.
Collaborative Tools: Utilized Git, dbt, and SQL for data transformation and version control.

Tools and Technologies
Languages: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Data Pipeline: SQL, dbt
Visualization: Power BI, Looker Studio
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn for modeling and prediction
Collaboration: GitHub for version control and teamwork

The Team
This project was brought to life by a team of four data enthusiasts:

Béatrice Michel
Christophe de la Paz-y-Féliz
Timothé Janna
Sofia Rezgui-Villaume
Under the guidance of Eddine Sadok and the amazing teaching assistants at Le Wagon, we tackled challenges ranging from data cleaning and feature engineering to creating a seamless user experience in our dashboard.

What's Next?
We’re excited to present our insights and make our findings accessible to a wider audience. Check out our repository to explore the code and learn more about how we tackled this vital topic.
